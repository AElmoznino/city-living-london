# city-living-london

__Intro:__ One of my earliest (half-finished) projects at Elevation Academy.

__Task:__ Build a HTML and CSS clone of [City Living London](http://city-living.london).

__Requirements:__ Had to build our own CSS framework for a grid (Bootstrap wasn't allowed). I used Shoestrap.
